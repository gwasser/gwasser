### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Garret. I am a cybersecurity professional that finds the typical corporate or academic environment a little too stuffy for creative work. I enjoy working on challenges that need cross-disciplinary solutions, as well as teaching and mentoring others.

I am currently a Security Engineer on the Vulnerability Management team at GitLab. Previously, I was a Vulnerability Analyst at the CERT/CC at the Software Engineering Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. I coauthored the [CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://certcc.github.io/CERT-Guide-to-CVD/) as well as authoring other technical reports, notes, and professional blogs on cybersecurity topics and developing prototype tools for vulnerability and malware analysis. Prior to that, I taught science, mathematics, and technology courses as an adjunct at several post-secondary colleges and institutes.
